## About Me
Hello! I'm a senior studying Cognitive Brain Science and minoring in Computer Science. I'm taking this class to fulfill my Classics culture requirement, but it also ties in with my minor in a really cool way!

## Some Things I Think Are Cool
Here's a link to a [time capsule](https://erynns-time-capsule.carrd.co/#) I made recently.

And some things I did over the break:
- Start knitting a sweater
- Saw a semi-frozen waterfall
- Spent all my time with my cat

Thanks for reading! Excited to work on these projects this semester.
