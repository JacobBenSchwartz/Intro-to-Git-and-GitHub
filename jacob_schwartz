I am a senior majoring in Ancient World Studies with a minor in Religion. I am from Connecticut, and I use he/him pronouns.
I am taking this course because I am interested in a career in academia in Classics, and I think having skills in Digital Humanities is going to be increasingly useful in that field. Also, I just think it will be interesting!
