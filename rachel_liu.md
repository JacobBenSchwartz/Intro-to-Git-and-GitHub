Hi! My name is Rachel Liu. I'm a senior studying biology with a minor in French. I am originally from upstate New York - near Albany. Outside of class, I am an editor for the [_Tufts Daily_](https://www.tuftsdaily.com/staff/rachel-liu) and a member of a cardiovascular research lab at Tufts Medical Center. Some of my hobbies are cooking/baking, reading, and exploring Boston. I'm taking this class because my friend recommended it from a previous semester and I wanted to learn Python.
