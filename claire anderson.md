## About
Hello! I'm Claire. I'm a senior from the Chicago area. I'm an FMS major and a sociology minor. I'm taking this class mostly just because it sounded interesting :) but also when I started college I wanted to be a Classics major so this is a fun connection to that.

## Some Fun Facts
- I had a phase where I tried to learn to speedrun *Celeste*. My best time in any% is about an hour and a half (only a little more than an hour longer than the world record!)
- I used to be a bartender
- I have been to 25 US states and 15 countries
- I watched 61 movies in 2024
