OVERVIEW
- Hello, my name is Chase Beyer. I am a second year premed student at tufts majoring in Biology and minoring in Finance. I play lacrosse here at tufts and enjoy spending time with my teammates outside of school. My hobbies at home include camping, fishing, snowmobiling, skiing, lifting and spending time outside with my family and friends.
